# Almalinux-updater

A small bash script to make installing updates on AlmaLinux 8.5 (Arctic Sphynx) alot simpler, from command line.

Before you start using this take the following in consideration:
1. be sure that you have the right repositories setup -> https://wiki.almalinux.org/repos/
2. be sure that you have root access to run the script and internet connection

Happy updating ! :)
